        "Importance of Immutable Dictionary Keys\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Consistency and Integrity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Reason: Dictionary keys are used to quickly locate values through hashing. If a key could be changed, it would alter the hash value, potentially causing inconsistencies and making it impossible to find the associated value.\n",
        "Example: Imagine a dictionary where the keys are mutable. If you use a list as a key and then modify the list, the dictionary would no longer be able to find the value associated with that key.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Hashing:\n",
        "\n",
        "Reason: Dictionaries in Python use hashing to ensure fast access to values. The hash function depends on the key being constant. If the key were mutable and changed, the hash value could change, which would disrupt the dictionary’s ability to retrieve the value.\n",
        "Example: If you used a mutable type like a list as a key, the hash value could change if the list were modified. This would break the dictionary’s internal structure and lead to errors or inconsistencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Reason: Immutable keys guarantee that the hash value remains constant, leading to efficient and predictable performance. This immutability allows dictionaries to quickly look up values without having to rehash keys.\n",
        "Example: With immutable keys, dictionaries can maintain constant-time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions. Mutable keys would prevent this efficiency and could degrade performance."
